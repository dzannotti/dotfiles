* Base16 themes for Emacs

[[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][Base16]] provides carefully chosen syntax highlighting and a default set of
sixteen colors suitable for a wide range of applications. Base16 is both a color
scheme and a template. To roll your own see [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder][base16-builder]].

This repository provides the [[http://melpa.org/#/base16-theme][MELPA]] package for Emacs, for convenience. I will do
my best to keep it in sync with the builder. If I fall behind, feel free to open
an issue or pull request.

*Please file any bugs in the templates [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder/issues][in the builder]].*
